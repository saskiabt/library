In this project I am creating a library app that takes user input for BOOK INFO, and creates a javascript object with it, storing it in the user's 'library' within the app. 

Still to do 6/9: 
Add delete buttons to each of the cards to remove them from display
Add edit button to the cards to edit the input?
Add checkbox to to card to check off if read or not
